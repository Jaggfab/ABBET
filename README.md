# Testing Github
Allright. This is a first repository on github. Just to see how it works and try it out.
I always used SVN, with TortoiseSVN on Windows and RapidSVN (manually managing branches and merges) on Ubuntu, for IEC61131-3 projects, as well for C++ projects.

So. This is it. My first commit on github, and soon my first pull request... but text only. No code for now.

Oh, and this will also be my first merge on github. NOICE !!

# SVN ftw
This branch is to explore some experimentations about how github works.
For now I'm still unconvinced to use it... My private SVN server is doing a great job.
