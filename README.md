# Testing Github
Allright. This is a first repository on github. Just to see how it works and try it out.
I always used SVN, with TortoiseSVN on Windows and RapidSVN (manually managing branches and merges) for IEC61131-3 projects, as well for C++ projects.

Now that Github has been acquired by Microsoft, I'm unsure if I'll really want to use it in the future..
But I feel like a lot of collaborative projects out there will continue to exist on that platform.

So. This is it. My first commit on github, and soon my first pull request... but text only. No code for now.
